# projects
This repository contains coding projects which I have completed outside of schools hours as extra curricular activities.
Each file is an individual program which aims to demonstrate fundamental algorithims in computer science.
The first program demonstrates the "mergesort" sorting algorithim
The second program demonstrates the "binary search" searching algorithm
