# projects
This repository contains coding projects which I have completed outside of schools hours as extra curricular activities.
Each file is an individual program which aims to demonstrate fundamental algorithms in computer science.

The first program demonstrates the "binary search" searching algorithm

The second program demonstrates the "mergesort" sorting algorithm

The third program shows how all primes less than a given number can be calculated by utilizing the fact that at least one of the non zero factors of a number must be smaller than the squareroot of that number.

The fourth program demonstrates the "quicksort" sorting algorithm
